## About this Site

What you find on this blog are just some developer notes. I just needed a space, where I could jot down some of my thoughts and notes for easy look ups. If it helps someone else: Even better.

On this blog you'll find stuff like:
* Cheatsheets
* Templates
* Some software develoment thoughts
* Maybe some how-tos?

I am your plain old Java developer.

My core development environment usually consists of Eclipse, Maven, Gradle, Subversion, Git, and a Linux derivative.
